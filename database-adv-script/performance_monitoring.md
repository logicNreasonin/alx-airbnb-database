# Continuous Performance Monitoring and Refinement

Monitoring and refining database performance is an ongoing process. As data grows and query patterns change, previously efficient queries can become bottlenecks. This objective demonstrates a cycle of: **Analyze -> Identify -> Adjust -> Measure -> Report**.

## Objective
To analyze the performance of a complex query, identify inefficiencies, suggest/implement adjustments (primarily indexing), and report the observed improvements.

### Tool
We will use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (or equivalent commands like `ANALYZE` in SQL Server/Oracle, `EXPLAIN` followed by `SHOW PROFILE` in older MySQL, or `EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION` in newer MySQL). In this example, we will use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, which is common in PostgreSQL.

## Target Query: Complex Booking Details Query

The query retrieves all bookings along with user, property, and payment details.

```sql
-- complex_booking_details.sql (Renamed for clarity in this context)
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.user_id AS user_id, -- Alias user_id from users table
    u.username,
    u.email,
    p.property_id AS property_id, -- Alias property_id from properties table
    p.property_name,
    pmt.payment_id,
    pmt.amount,
    pmt.payment_date,
    pmt.status AS payment_status -- Alias status from payments table
FROM
    bookings b
INNER JOIN
    users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id         -- Join with users on user_id
INNER JOIN
    properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id -- Join with properties on property_id
INNER JOIN
    payments pmt ON b.booking_id = pmt.booking_id -- Join with payments on booking_id
ORDER BY
    b.start_date DESC;
```

### Step 1: Monitor Performance Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE (Baseline)

We execute the target query prefixed with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see its actual execution plan and statistics before any specific performance tuning.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.user_id AS user_id,
    u.username,
    u.email,
    p.property_id AS property_id,
    p.property_name,
    pmt.payment_id,
    pmt.amount,
    pmt.payment_date,
    pmt.status AS payment_status
FROM
    bookings b
INNER JOIN
    users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN
    properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN
    payments pmt ON b.booking_id = pmt.booking_id
ORDER BY
    b.start_date DESC;
```

**Analyze the Output**:
The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output provides detailed information about how the database executed the query. Key things to look for:
- **Total Execution Time**: This is the primary metric to reduce.
- **Scan Types**:
  - `Seq Scan` or `Table Scan`: Reading the entire table, which is slow on large datasets.
  - `Index Scan`: Using an index to find rows, faster than full table scans.
  - `Index Only Scan` (PostgreSQL): Reading data directly from the index, very fast.
- **Join Methods**: (e.g., Hash Join, Nested Loop, Merge Join)
- **Rows**: The actual number of rows processed or returned by each operation.
- **Costs**: Estimated costs for each operation.

---

### Step 2: Suggest Changes (Schema Adjustments / New Indexes)

**Identified Bottlenecks:**
- `Seq Scan` operations on the `bookings`, `users`, `properties`, and `payments` tables during join phases.
- High execution time attributed to full table scans.
- Sorting overhead for the `ORDER BY b.start_date DESC`.

**Suggested Changes:**
- Add indexes on foreign key columns used in joins:
  - `bookings.user_id`
  - `bookings.property_id`
  - `payments.booking_id`
- Create an index for the `ORDER BY` clause:
  - `bookings.start_date DESC`

**SQL Commands:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings (user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings (property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking_id ON payments (booking_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_start_date_desc ON bookings (start_date DESC);
```

---

### Step 3: Implement Changes

Apply the suggested index changes by running the `CREATE INDEX` commands. Update the `database_index.sql` file to include the new indexes.

---

### Step 4: Measure Performance After Implementing Changes

Re-run the query prefixed with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT ...
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
INNER JOIN payments pmt ON b.booking_id = pmt.booking_id
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
```

**Analyze the New Output:**
- Look for `Index Scan` or `Index Only Scan` operations replacing `Seq Scans`.
- Compare execution times and costs before and after indexing.

---

### Step 5: Report the Improvements

**Performance Improvement Report:**
- **Before Indexing**:
  - Total Execution Time: [e.g., 1500 ms]
- **After Indexing**:
  - Total Execution Time: [e.g., 50 ms]
  - Improvement: [e.g., Query is now 30x faster]

This completes the cycle: **Monitor -> Identify -> Adjust -> Measure -> Report**
